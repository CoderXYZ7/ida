# Position Paper: Republic of Albania

## Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in Africa

The **Republic of Albania** acknowledges the **African Union (AU)** as a pivotal institution in tackling the illicit trade and manufacturing of **Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW)**. We recognize the **Bamako Declaration** and its evolution into the **AU Strategy**, alongside the **Kinshasa Convention**, as key instruments in addressing this issue.

### Key Concerns

- The **negative impact** of illicit arms trade on states, local communities, and individuals.
- The **interconnected nature** of SALW proliferation with organized crime, border security failures, and political instability.
- The necessity of a **legally binding Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)** to reinforce existing frameworks.

### International Commitments

- **United Nations (UN) Programme of Action** on SALW.
- **Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)** agreements.
- **Stability Pact** with its **SALW Regional Implementation Plan**.

### Measures & Recommendations

#### **Weapons Traceability & Regulation**

- **Marking & National Databases** for complete traceability.
- **Standardized End-Use Certificates** for global enforcement.
- **Compliance with Global Guidelines** by the international community.

#### **International Cooperation & Assistance**

- Strengthen coordination with **Regional Centre on Small Arms (RECSA)** and **Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)**.
- Encourage **NGO participation** in arms control and peacebuilding efforts.
- Call for **financial and technical assistance** to states combating SALW trade.

#### **Lessons from Albania**

- **Weapons in Exchange for Development (UNDP Program):**
  - Successfully reduced civilian-held arms through voluntary surrender.
  - Promoted law enforcement trust and a **culture of peace**.
- Recommends **similar programs** for African states.
- Aligns with efforts to achieve the **Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)**.
