## I. Introduction  

The Republic of Djibouti remains committed to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and recognizes the urgency of addressing poverty eradication amidst global crises. As a small but strategically positioned nation in the Horn of Africa, Djibouti has faced compounding challenges, including climate change, economic disruptions, food insecurity, and geopolitical instability. However, through resilient policies and innovative solutions, the government continues to prioritize sustainable development, poverty reduction, and economic diversification.

## II. Challenges to Poverty Eradication in Times of Crisis**  

Djibouti acknowledges that the world is undergoing multiple crises that threaten sustainable development and poverty alleviation. These include:

1. **Economic Disruptions:** Global inflation, trade imbalances, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have hindered economic growth and job creation.
2. **Climate Change:** Rising temperatures, droughts, and water scarcity disproportionately affect vulnerable populations and hinder agricultural productivity.
3. **Food and Energy Security:** Supply chain disruptions have exacerbated food and energy shortages, increasing the cost of living for marginalized communities.
4. **Regional Instability:** Conflicts in neighboring regions impact trade, security, and economic stability, further straining national resources.

## III. Djiboutiâ€™s Strategies and Policy Recommendations  

To effectively address poverty eradication and reinforce the 2030 Agenda, Djibouti proposes the following measures:

1. **Strengthening Economic Resilience:** Promoting economic diversification through investments in trade, logistics, and renewable energy to reduce reliance on external markets.
2. **Innovative Social Protection Mechanisms:** Expanding cash transfer programs, social safety nets, and employment opportunities to support vulnerable populations during crises.
3. **Sustainable Infrastructure Development:** Enhancing digital connectivity, water management systems, and transportation networks to boost economic opportunities and service delivery.
4. **Climate Adaptation and Green Growth:** Implementing renewable energy projects, afforestation initiatives, and sustainable agriculture practices to combat environmental vulnerabilities.
5. **Regional and International Cooperation:** Engaging with international organizations and neighboring countries to foster trade, development financing, and crisis response mechanisms.
6. **Investing in Human Capital:** Strengthening education, vocational training, and healthcare systems to empower youth and ensure long-term socio-economic stability.

## IV. Conclusion  

Djibouti reaffirms its commitment to eradicating poverty and achieving the 2030 Agenda despite ongoing global challenges. The country calls upon ECOSOC and the international community to enhance cooperation, increase development financing, and support innovative policies that ensure resilient and sustainable solutions for all.
